// UnorderedMap in STL
// Author: REET

/*
Same as set and unordered_set difference.
Stores element not in any sorted fashion.
Takes constant time to insert element
whereas Map and MultiMap takes 
logarithmic time.
Disadvantage is hashing collision might 
happen and you might end up getting a TLE
or wrong answer error.
Highly preferable to use map but just in
case you get TLE or anything use 
unordered one.
