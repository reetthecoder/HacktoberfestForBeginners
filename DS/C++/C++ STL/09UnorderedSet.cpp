// Unordered Set in STL
// Author: REET

/*
Stores the element just like set but not
in a sorted fashion.
Doesn't stores duplicates.
lower_bound and upper_bound function also
doesn't work.
It stores the elements in such a fashion 
such that time complexity is constant in
average case.
Some collision may happen, try to avoid
in CP.
